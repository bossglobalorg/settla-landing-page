            Settla&apos;s story began with a simple but powerful question: How
            can we make financial systems work for everyone, especially those
            too often left out? We recognize the unique financial barriers
            African and Asian immigrant-owned businesses face, and we set out to
            build a platform that provides fair, easy, and secure access to
            global payments. Our mission is to give every business, no matter
            where it starts, the tools to move forward confidently.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-[#4D4D4D]">
            This is Settla&apos;s storyâ€”a commitment to growth, opportunity, and
            connection that we share with you.
